# BookWormOpenSource

BookWorm was an application which was originally developed as an open source android book library to keep track of books.
For CIS-3760 : Project Engineering our work group took this app to build upon it.
We completely changed the user interface as well as added back end database functionality and new features such as ability to sort books by folders, camera functionality for custom book covers, bookmark capabilities to keep track of the book among small fixes to the overall application.
